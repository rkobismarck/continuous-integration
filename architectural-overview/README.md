# Architectural overview.

We need to stablish an architectural overview for our E2E, CI/CD pipeline in such case we're gonna be using agnostiques technologies and whose main purpose is only to show what do we need, isolated of specific solutions.

In the next diagram we will try to show you what does it looks like a basic template for our software development process, we can see the main branches:

1. **Version control**: We need a software to handle the version control in our process, that means any popular handler for this task.

2. **Automation server**: We need a software whose main goal will be providing us with several tools in order to connect with the source code manager, and perform all the kind of operations that we need in order to scipt operations and the handling of our software pieces.

3. **Target infrastructure**: Usually here is gonna relly of infrastructure that provide us with a way to operate with our system,in such case it's very important to define how this is gonna be working and what are the minimum requirements to operate our software correctly.

Here you can see a quick diagram of this:
