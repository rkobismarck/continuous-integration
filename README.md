# CI/CD Implementation.
The purpose of this guide, is to show you away to construct a continuous integration strategy trough Docker-Jenkins related technologies. In this repository we're gonna describe how to implemente a continuous integration and delivery pipeline, in order to suppport our development and delivery process.This guide is based on several sources of information, you'll find the links at the end of the article.

### What will you need?
1. Github account or any other related GIT provider.
2. AWS or any other related Cloud infrastructure provider; in this case we're gonna be using AWS's EC2 plattform.
3. Basic knowledge about Jenkins, in order to orchestrate our pipeline or workflow.
4. Slack account for all the developers team.

### Assumptions.
There are some basic things that you need to know in order to be able to embrace this guideline, first of all we're going to assume that we will be creating this guide as an **ideal approachment** so any change could be posible in the workflow because we may need certain things very particullarly due to our very specifics problems. We're gonna rely in Cloud based infrastructure based on the fact that we assume this ways, as a better way to gain speed and be in a better position if it's need some kind of horizontal growth in any epic of the software development process. 

### Minimal prerequisites in order to proceed with:
1. AWS Account, if you don't have one you can always create one and apply for free of charges products in at least the first 12 months.
 [Sign Up](https://aws.amazon.com/console/). 
2. Even I've created previously a quick guide to support your account creation and instance setting up process, I'm sure that you can take a look on this repository.

### What's the problem?
First of all, let me introduce you this question it's seems like an easy one but it's a little bit more tricky than you can think. In first instance we need to setup a workflow that allows our team being able to raise the productivity and predictibilty of our software. In such case we need to take a look inside the modern proposal of a methodology whose main goal will be providing us an entire plattform where we can develop, test and integrate our changes in a software development process; and that will be our mission for today.


#### What's the proposal?
Here you're gonna be presented with several documents and specifications, whose main purpose will be shape the solution of the e2e process and implementation. It will be divided in several directories, so feel free to wander in all of them this will provide you with a strong basis and I'm sure will raise the discussion about certain topics that i'd love to be aware. Just open up the conversation.

> Architectural overview.

> Technological overview.

> Implementation map and propossal of solution.
